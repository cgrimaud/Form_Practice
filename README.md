## Form Practice

This is my first project for Code Louisville.

In this repo, I have creating a form with elements that are hidden or shown based on the fields that are selected/answered. 

This project idea was inspired by my current job, where I would like an IT Ticket Request form to be formatted this way though it cannot due to the ticket system being free software, thus very limiting.
